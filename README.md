# DealOrNoDeal

This was a group project which was made by four of us at Boston College to show a statistical representation of the game "Deal or No Deal"

- Project File is the completed project made through the use of Tkinter
- DealorNoDeal.py is our code without the implementation without the GUI
- Calulation.py is used to find the offer based on what round you are in
- Dealorno.xlsx is our cited excel sheet we used in calculation.py
- Differentcases.py is used to show that it doesn't matter what case you pick at the beginning
- Montehall.py is used to simulate a Monte Hall where it determines if the chances of winning are the same if you switch or not
